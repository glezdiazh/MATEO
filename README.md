## Abstract

Chiral Phosphoric Acid (CPA) catalysts are widely recognized and versatile tools in catalysis and organic synthesis useful for the synthesis of chiral products. MATEO: InterMolecular Amidoalkylation Theoretical Enantioselectivity Optimization is an online Cheminformatics tool intended to help in the design of new CPAs, available online at: https://cptmltool.rnasa-imedir.com/CPTMLTools-Web/mateo.
